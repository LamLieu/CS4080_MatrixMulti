	In this group project, I was tasked with writing the program used in testing in Python. 
Lam Lieu finished his Java code first, so I decided to make my code similar to his in the way that it was structured. 
We all decided that using matrix multiplication was going to be the way to go in this experiment as we would have to pass arrays and access their contents frequently. 
What I did to help the team, was creating a text document that compiled the information for passing parameters from the book and from the internet as well as breaking it down to language specific features. 
I also started the powerpoint for the proposal, and wrote several parts of the paper. 
I wrote the abstract, intro, a large portion of the methods, as well as the future work and the conclusion.
